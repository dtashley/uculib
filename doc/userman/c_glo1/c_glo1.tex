\item \index{divides}%
      \mbox{\boldmath $ \vworkdivides $}

      $a \vworkdivides b$, 
      read ``\emph{$a$ divides $b$}'', denotes that $b/a$ has no remainder.
      Equivalently,
      $(a \vworkdivides b) \Rightarrow (\exists c \in \vworkintset{}, b = ac)$.

\item \index{divides}%
      \mbox{\boldmath $ \vworknotdivides $}

      $a \vworknotdivides b$, 
      read ``\emph{$a$ does not divide $b$}'', denotes that $b/a$ has a reminder.
      Equivalently,
      $(a \vworknotdivides b) \Rightarrow (\nexists c \in \vworkintset{}, b = ac)$.

\item \index{floor function}%
      \mbox{\boldmath $ \lfloor \cdot \rfloor $}

      The \emph{floor} function.  $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the largest
      integer not larger than $x$.

\item \index{ceiling function}%
      \mbox{\boldmath $\lceil \cdot \rceil$ }

      The \emph{ceiling} function.
      $\lceil x \rceil$
      is the smallest integer not smaller than $x$.

%\section*{Bitfields And Portions Of Integers}
%
%\begin{vworkmathtermglossaryenum}
%\item \mbox{\boldmath $a_{b}$}
%
%      The $b$th bit of the integer $a$.  Bits are numbered with the
%      least significant bit ``0'', and consecutively through 
%      ``$n-1$'', where $n$ is the total number of bits.
%
%      In general, if $p$ is an $n$-bit unsigned integer,
%
%      \begin{equation}
%      \nonumber p = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^i p_i .
%      \end{equation}
%
%\item \mbox{\boldmath $a_{c:b}$}
%
%      The integer consisting of the $b$th through the
%      $c$th bits of the integer $a$.  Bits are numbered with the
%      least significant bit ``0'', and consecutively through 
%      ``$n-1$'', where $n$ is the total number of bits.
%
%      For example, if $p$ is a 24-bit unsigned integer, then
%
%      \begin{equation}
%      \nonumber p = 2^{16}p_{23:16} + 2^{8}p_{15:8} + p_{7:0} .
%      \end{equation}
%
%\item \mbox{\boldmath $a_{[b]}$}
%
%      The $b$th word of the integer $a$.  Words are numbered 
%      with the
%      least significant word ``0'', and consecutively through 
%      ``$n-1$'', where $n$ is the total number of words.
%
%      In general, if $p$ is an $n$-word unsigned integer 
%      and $z$ is the wordsize in bits,
%
%      \begin{equation}
%      \nonumber p = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2^{iz} p_i .
%      \end{equation}
%
%\item \mbox{\boldmath $a_{[c:b]}$}
%
%      The integer consisting of the $b$th through the
%      $c$th word of the integer $a$.  Words are numbered with the
%      least significant word ``0'', and consecutively through 
%      ``$n-1$'', where $n$ is the total number of words.
%
%      For example, if $p$ is a 24-word unsigned integer and
%      $z$ is the wordsize in bits, then
%
%      \begin{equation}
%      \nonumber p = 2^{16z}p_{[23:16]} + 2^{8z}p_{[15:8]} + p_{[7:0]} .

%\section*{Matrices And Vectors}
%
%\begin{vworkmathtermglossaryenum}
%
%\item \mbox{\boldmath $0$}
%
%      $\mathbf{0}$ (in bold face) is used to denote either a vector or matrix
%      populated with all zeroes.  Optionally, in cases where the context is not clear
%      or where there is cause to highlight the dimension, $\mathbf{0}$ may be subscripted
%      to indicate the dimension, i.e. 
%      
%      \begin{equation}
%      \nonumber
%      \mathbf{0}_3 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right]
%      \end{equation}
%
%      \begin{equation}
%      \nonumber
%      \mathbf{0}_{3 \times 2} = \left[\begin{array}{cc} 0&0 \\ 0&0 \\ 0&0 \end{array}\right]
%      \end{equation}
%
%\item \mbox{\boldmath $I$}
%
%      $I$ is used to denote the square identity matrix (the matrix with all
%      elements 0 except elements on the diagonal which are 1).
%      Optionally, in cases where the context is not clear
%      or where there is cause to highlight the dimension, $I$ may be subscripted
%      to indicate the dimension, i.e. 
%      
%      \begin{equation}
%      \nonumber
%      I = I_3 = I_{3 \times 3} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc} 1&0&0 \\ 0&1&0 \\ 0&0&1 \end{array}\right]
%      \end{equation}
